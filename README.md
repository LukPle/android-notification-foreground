The android-notification-foreground app contains an **EditText** field for user input. Its content gets displayed in a Android **Notification** that uses a 
**NotificationChannel** and a **NotificationManager**. The application serves as an example of these features.

## Features
The setting of this program is a reminder app. The user can create a new reminder by filling the EditText field with some text. Clicking the Button creates a Notification
that takes the content of the EditText field. This Notification gets displayed on the screen and stays in the Notification Center of the phone afterwards. </br>
